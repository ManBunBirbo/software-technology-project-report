\subsection{Running time} \label{sec:test-running-time}

For testing running times, a simple class \texttt{runTimeTimer} was made. It has
two methods \texttt{start()} and \texttt{stop()}. \texttt{start()} must be called
before the code chunk to be examined. \texttt{stop()} must be called just after.
The running time will appear in milliseconds in the console.
