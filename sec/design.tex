\section{Problem analysis and design} \label{sec:analysis-design} 

The main challenges are already hinted at in section~\ref{sec:goals}. All these
goals pose different problems. These problems (and especially their solutions)
is best analyzed when also discussing the chosen design. 

\subsection{The algorithm}
