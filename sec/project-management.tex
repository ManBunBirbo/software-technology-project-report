\section{Project Management and Tools}

This project ended up being a one-man-project. Therefor not many collaboration
tools were used as it seemed unnecessary. 

\begin{description}
    \item[GitHub] GitHub has mostly been used for version control. This has been
    a great tool for experimenting with new stuff as a backup point could easily be
    created and reverted back to. There desktop client is also incredibly easy
    to use. 

    \item[Notion] Notion is a very strong software for project management. It
    allows for Trello-like kanban boards. Notion is also greats for taking notes
    as each task on the kanban contains a page for notes. This is done in the
    markdown language. 

    \item[IntelliJ IDEA] The IDE used for coding the program. JetBrains, the
    company making IntelliJ, gives there software for free to students. 

    \item[VSCode] Microsofts all-in-one IDE is used for writing the {\LaTeX}
    "code" for this report. 

    \item[SceneBuilder]

    \item[Pen and paper] Nothing beats old school pen and paper for visualizing
    algorithms and getting the logic of the program clear.
