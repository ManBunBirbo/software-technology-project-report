\section{Project Management}

During the project, the following programs and applications have been used. Due
to the fact that this projects is made by one person, the amount of
collaboration tools is not overwhelming: 

\begin{description}
    \item[GitHub] GitHub has mostly been used for version control. This has been
    a great tool for experimenting with new stuff as a backup point could easily be
    created and reverted back to. There desktop client is also incredibly easy
    to use. 

    \item[Notion] Notion is a very strong software for project management. It
    allows for Trello-like kanban boards. Notion is also greats for taking notes
    as each task on the kanban contains a page for notes. This is done in the
    markdown language. 

    \item[IntelliJ IDEA] The IDE used for coding the program. JetBrains, the
    company making IntelliJ, gives there software for free to students. 

    \item[VSCode] Microsofts all-in-one IDE is used for writing the {\LaTeX}
    "code" for this report. 

    \item[SceneBuilder]

    \item[Pen and paper] Nothing beats old school pen and paper for visualizing
    algorithms and getting the logic of the program clear.
