\subsection{Limiting the problem}


\subsection{Goals}

A prioritized list of the goals for the project is listed below. While adding a
lot of features seems very appealing, I will in this project focus on usability,
stability, and speed. This leads to a somewhat conservative list of potential
features, but the quality of the final product will reflect this decision. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement the algorithm using the rectangle-method from \textbf{the
    paper} in Java. 
    
    \item Visualize two-dimensional time series graphs together with the
    rectangles produced by the algorithm in a simple GUI. This GUI will allow
    user to load a time series data file and see the output of the algorithm on
    the time series. 

    \item Make the algorithm more flexible by allowing the user to alter the
    values of algorithm-parameters in the GUI. 

    
    
\end{enumerate}
